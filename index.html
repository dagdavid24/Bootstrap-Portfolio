                My name is Dag David Osei. I am a Ghanaian and a student at Ryerson University. I love to play sports, read, and watch documentaries.
                I believe to know about me a little better I must tell a joke.

                Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson went out on a camping trip in the late summer of 1890. On one night while asleep in the woods,
                Sherlock woke up from his sleep, paused for a bit and woke his friend Watson. He said "Watson, look up into
                the sky and tell me what you see". Watson's reply was "Well it's a clear night. Moon and stars are very visible.
                If you're talking about what they represent, I think the stars are just like our own sun and probably represent
                other soloar systems like ours, even with the possibility of intelligent life existing out there". Sherlock
                paused for a while and then responded, "well that's fine and dandy but I think our tent is stolen".

                How does does this relate to me? Well one of the philosophies of life I try to live by is that you shouldn't be fixated too
                much on far reaching ideas to understand and solve your problems. Sometimes the answer to them lies right
                in front of you.
